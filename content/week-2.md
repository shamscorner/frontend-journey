# Week - 2

Congratulations to whoever completed the **week-1** module ü•≥. You made a great start üöÄ. Some of you may be wondering why the first week seemed to be mostly theoretical. Let‚Äôs debunk this with a story before starting with our actual content.

‚ÄúOur main character is Lisa. She recently received a project from one of her clients, but is having a hard time understanding the requirements. She has been reading over them repeatedly for a long time, but has made no progress üòï. Finally, after an hour she managed to understand, but it was too late as her client had already assigned the project to someone else‚Äù üò≠.

‚ÄúThe next day, feeling frustrated, she applied for more projects and finally got another one. This time, she quickly reviewed the requirements and promptly responded to her client. The client assigned her the project and began discussing additional details with her üòç. However, as a non-native English speaker, she had a hard time understanding her client üòü. She missed a lot of their conversation and felt discouraged‚Äù üò≠.

What went wrong? What can we learn from this story?

- Communication is crucial.
- To communicate effectively, you need to be able to read quickly and summarize the content.
- Additionally, you must listen attentively and capture valuable information simultaneously.

That's why I assigned many articles and videos to help you improve your reading and listening skills on the 1st week. Because, trust me, I experienced this same issue initially, and it's likely happening to you as well. Therefore, we need to prepare.

So with that, let‚Äôs get back to our week 2 module üöÄ. After end of this week:

- You should be able to create basic websites by yourself
- You will know how to code in VSCode
- You will be familiar with the science behind HTML in browser

_Follow this comprehensive day-by-day guide to fulfill your dream of becoming an ultimate professional developer in the future._

# Day - 1

### How website are made? A full story!

Don't take this tutorial too seriously. It's just meant to give you an idea of how a developer (human) develops a full-scale application. It is totally different than how you see on the movies üòÇ. Try to observe how he handles problems and how he tackles them. And most importantly, just enjoy the process! (Just watch, don‚Äôt code, don‚Äôt think much how)

### VSCode is my life ü•∞

We will setup the VSCode where you will spend most of your time coding. So I think it is a good practice to know most of the features of it so that you won‚Äôt get lost.

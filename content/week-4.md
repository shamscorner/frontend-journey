# Week - 4

I hope you've been having an awesome time learning in Week 3 Module because let me tell you, you're killing it! Your hard work and dedication are paying off, and you should be proud of yourself.

Remember, if you ever need a break from studying, I'm here to share some fun facts.

Did you know that the first computer mouse was made of wood?

That's right, in 1964, a prototype of the computer mouse was built by Douglas Engelbart, and it was made out of a block of wood with a single button. It's hard to imagine using something so primitive now that we have wireless mice with multiple buttons and scrolling capabilities.

- write beautiful HTML code with professional level style guide
- get familiar with different symbols, emojis, entities, charsets, etc. on HTML

# Day - 1

We‚Äôve learned a lot of things of HTML Writing clean and organized HTML is crucial for creating maintainable and scalable web projects. We're going to cover some essential tips and best practices for creating an HTML style guide. From formatting and indentation to naming conventions and code structure. Let's get started!

Have you ever tried to include special characters like ¬© or ¬Æ in your HTML code, only to find that they don't display correctly in the browser? That's where HTML entities come in. An HTML entity is a piece of text that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). It's used to represent special characters and symbols that can't be included in HTML code directly.

In this short intro, we'll explore what HTML entities are, why they're important, and how to use them in your HTML code.

Please remember that you don‚Äôt have to memorize any of these. Just copy paste the code when you need them.

[HTML Emojis](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_emojis.asp)

[HTML Charset](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_charset.asp)

HTML URLs, or Uniform Resource Locators, are an essential part of navigating the web. They provide a standardized way to access web resources, such as web pages, images, videos, and more. We'll explore the fundamentals of what URLs are, how they work, and why they're important.

# Day - 2

_Why did HTML break up with XHTML?_

_Because HTML said, "I like my tags loose and flexible," but XHTML was like, "I prefer them strict and well-formed." They just couldn't see eye to eye on markup!_

I know this is a boring Joke but it makes sense right? üòÑ

So let‚Äôs take a look between them.

[HTML Versus XHTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_xhtml.asp)

HTML forms are an essential component of building interactive websites. With forms, users can input and submit data, such as contact information, search queries, and more. HTML forms allow for user interaction and engagement, making websites more dynamic and user-friendly. In this context, we can say that HTML forms provide a means for communication between users and websites.

HTML media allows web developers to embed various multimedia content, such as images, videos, and audio, into their websites. This not only enhances the visual and auditory experience for users but also allows for more engaging and interactive content. With HTML media, web developers can customize the appearance and functionality of multimedia elements, such as controlling the size and playback of videos and audio files. In this way, HTML media plays a critical role in creating compelling and dynamic web content.
